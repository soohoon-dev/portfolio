## ANALYZE: Performance Deep Dive

### 1. Programmatic Display: Sales Campaign Evolution

**Comparison:** Dec 2021 (29d) vs Jul 2025 (21d)

#### 2021 Baseline: Getaway Sales (Broad Reach Strategy)

- Budget: $17,726
- Impressions: 14.8M
- Clicks: 26,807
- CTR: **0.18%**
- CPC: **$0.66**
- CPM: $1.20

#### 2025 Optimized: Summer Sales Hybrid (Precision Strategy)

- Budget: $5,499 (**69% cost reduction**)
- Impressions: 2.8M (focused audience)
- Clicks: 107,135 (**4x increase**)
- CTR: **3.86%** (+2,044%)
- CPC: **$0.05** (-92%)
- CPM: $1.98

**Strategic Insight:**
The 81% reduction in impressions wasn't a failure—it represented eliminating low-quality inventory. By focusing on high-propensity audiences, we achieved a 21x CTR improvement while reducing cost per engagement by 92%. The hybrid vehicle's smaller addressable market actually benefited from precision targeting.

**Hypothesis Validation:** ✅ H1 confirmed—precision targeting dramatically improved engagement metrics while reducing waste.

**Comparison:** May 2024 vs Jul 2025 Launch (14d, ~$1,820 budget)

| Metric              | 2024 Santa Fe | 2025 IONIQ 9 | Change     |
| ------------------- | ------------- | ------------ | ---------- |
| **Impressions**     | 205,190       | 287,101      | **+40%**   |

| **CPC (reference)** | $606          | $202         | -67%       |

**Strategic Insight:**
By negotiating better CPM rates and optimizing inventory sources, we maintained the same $1,820 budget while achieving 40% more reach. The sustained 98% completion rate demonstrates that efficiency gains didn't compromise audience quality—viewers remained highly engaged.

**Hypothesis Validation:** ✅ H2 confirmed—CTV delivered both scale and efficiency improvements.

| Metric              | 2024 Santa Fe | 2025 IONIQ 9 | Change   |
| ------------------- | ------------- | ------------ | -------- |
| **Views**           | 265,701       | 369,520      | **+39%** |

| ------------------- | -------- | -------- | --------- |
| **Views**           | 372,516  | 700,601  | **+88%**  |
| **View Rate**       | 47.16%   | 61.58%   | **+14pp** |

**Strategic Insight:**
YouTube's auction improvements and our refined audience targeting delivered a double win: halving the cost per view while dramatically improving view quality. The 14-point increase in completion rate (47% → 62%) indicates we're reaching more engaged audiences who watch the entire ad.

### 4. Paid Search: Quality Over Volume

**Comparison:** Dec 2021 vs Jul 2025 (29d)

| Metric          | 2021    | 2025   | Change      |
| --------------- | ------- | ------ | ----------- |
| **Clicks**      | 2,184   | 1,177  | -46%        |
| **Impressions** | 620,322 | 21,630 | **-96.5%**  |
| **CTR**         | 0.35%   | 5.44%  | **+1,454%** |
| **CPC**         | $0.49   | $1.41  | +188%       |
| **CPM**         | $1.74   | $76.88 | N/A         |

**Strategic Insight:**
The massive impression drop reflects a deliberate shift from broad match keywords to exact/phrase match high-intent queries. While CPC tripled, CTR improved 15x—meaning we're paying more per click but getting dramatically better qualified traffic. The reduced click volume (2,184 → 1,177) represents eliminating tire-kickers in favor of in-market shoppers.

**Hypothesis Validation:** ✅ H3 confirmed—high-intent focus improved CTR substantially despite higher CPC.
