# Proposal: Operational Optimization & Zero-Budget Growth Strategy

**To:** Clinic Director  
**From:** Technical Marketing Lead  
**Subject:** Increasing Lead Conversion via Automation & UX Optimization

---

### 1. Executive Summary

Our analysis of recent website consultation logs confirms that the current acquisition channel is performing well (**100% completion rate for new users**). However, we identified two critical "leakage points" where high-value leads are being lost due to operational timing and UX friction.

We propose a **"Zero-Budget" optimization plan** focused on CRM automation and retention improvements, projected to recover **20%+ of lost leads** without increasing ad spend.

### 2. Key Findings (Data Evidence)

#### **A. The "9 PM Golden Time" Risk**

- **Insight:** The highest volume of consultation requests occurs at **21:00 (9 PM)**.
- **Risk:** These leads arrive after staff have left. Currently, they wait ~12 hours for a response, leading to a high drop-off rate as they likely contact competitors who offer instant booking.

#### **B. Returning User Friction**

- **Insight:** While new users convert perfectly, **25% of returning customers abandon the form**.
- **Root Cause:** Asking loyal customers to re-enter their full details (Age, Detailed Service Type) creates unnecessary friction.

### 3. Strategic Recommendations

#### **Phase 1: Night-Shift Automation (Immediate)**

**Action:** Implement an SMS/KakaoTalk Auto-Reply system for leads received between 8 PM - 9 AM.

- **Script:** _"Thank you for contacting us. We have received your request. Our head consultant will contact you priority at 10 AM tomorrow. In the meantime, view our [Melasma Treatment Results] gallery."_
- **Benefit:** "Locks in" the customer and prevents them from searching for other clinics.

#### **Phase 2: One-Click Booking (UX Fix)**

**Action:** Deploy a simplified "VIP Form" for returning clients.

- **Logic:** If `Phone Number` matches database → Skip detailed questions → Ask only for `Preferred Time`.
- **Benefit:** Expected to increase returning user conversion to **95%+**.

#### **Phase 3: Targeted "Melasma" Campaign (Future Growth)**

**Action:** When the budget allows, focus Meta Ads on "Women 30-50" interested in "Pigmentation."

- **Rationale:** Data proves "Dark Spot Treatment" is your strongest organic driver (30% of new leads).
